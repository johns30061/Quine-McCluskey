# Quine-McCluskey
> A Python/C++ implementation of Quine McCluskey(Tabulation ) method.

### Folder Structure:
- `tabulation.py` : Python3 implementation of the algorithm
- `tabulation.cpp`: C++ implementation of the algorithm
- `pla.py` : solves a `programmable logic array`. It uses tabulation to find possible solutions of n provided functions and then calculates the least combination that solves all functions.

> NOTE: pla.py is buggy
